## Introduction

TestNG is a testing framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs, from unit testing (testing a class in isolation of the others) to integration testing (testing entire systems made of several classes, several packages and even several external frameworks, such as application servers). Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD).

This BrowserStack Example repository demonstrates a Selenium test framework written in Cucumber and TestNG with parallel testing capabilties. The Selenium test scripts are written for the open source [BrowserStack Demo web application](https://bstackdemo.com) ([Github](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app)). This BrowserStack Demo App is an e-commerce web application which showcases multiple real-world user scenarios, written in Next and React. The app is bundled with offers data, orders data and products data that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

The Selenium tests are run on different platforms like on-prem, docker and BrowserStack using various run configurations and test capabilities.

## Repository setup

- Clone the repository

- For this infrastructure configuration (i.e on-premise), create the `drivers` folder at `/src/test/resources` and ensure that the ChromeDriver executable is placed in the `/src/test/resources/drivers` folder.

- Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on the machine
  - Java >= 8
  - Maven >= 3.1+
  - Gradle >= 5.0+

  Maven:
    ```sh
    mvn install
    ```

  Gradle:
    ```sh
    gradle build
    ```


# BrowserStack

[BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) provides instant access to 2,000+ real mobile devices and browsers on a highly reliable cloud infrastructure that effortlessly scales as testing needs grow.

## Prerequisites

- Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

  - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  - For Windows:

  ```shell
  set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username>
  set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can also hardcode username and access_key objects in the [caps.json](resources/conf/caps/caps.json) file.

Note:
- We have configured a list of test capabilities in the [caps.json](resources/conf/caps/caps.json) file. You can certainly update them based on your device / browser test requirements.
- The exact test capability values can be easily identified using the [Browserstack Capability Generator](https://browserstack.com/automate/capabilities)


## Running Your Tests

### Run a specific test on BrowserStack

In this section, we will run a single test on Chrome browser on Browserstack. To change test capabilities for this configuration, please refer to the `single` object in `caps.json` file.

- How to run the test?

  - To run the default test scenario (e.g. End to End Scenario) on your own machine, use the following command:

  Maven:
  ```sh
 mvn clean test -P bstack-parallel-browsers 
  ```

  Gradle:
    ```sh
  gradle test
  ```
